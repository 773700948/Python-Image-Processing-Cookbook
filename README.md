# Python-Image-Processing-Cookbook

This is the code repository for Python-Image-Processing-Cookbook, published by Packt.

Over 60 recipes to help you perform complex image processing and computer vision tasks with ease

## What is this book about?

With advancements in wireless devices and mobile technology, there's an increasing
demand for digital image processing skills to extract useful information from the evergrowing
volume of images. This book provides comprehensive coverage of tools and
algorithms, along with guiding you through analysis and visualization for image
processing.

With the help of over 60 cutting-edge recipes, you'll address common challenges in image
processing and learn how to perform complex tasks such as image detection, image
segmentation, and image reconstruction using large hybrid datasets. Dedicated sections
will also take you through implementing various image enhancement and image
restoration techniques such as cartooning, gradient blending, and sparse dictionary
learning. As you advance, you'll get to grips with face morphing and image segmentation
techniques. With an emphasis on practical solutions, this book will help you apply deep
learning-based techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning to solve real-world
problems.

## This book covers the following exciting features:

### Chapter 1 
Image Manipulation and Transformation, is where you will learn how to use
different Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, OpenCV, and Matplotlib) for image
manipulation and transformation. You will learn how to write Python code to do point
transforms (log/gamma transform, Gotham filter, colorspace transformation, and increasing
brightness/contrast) and geometric transforms (swirl transform, perspective transform, and
homography).

### Chapter 2 
Image Enhancement, is where you will learn how to use different Python libraries
(NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, OpenCV, PyWavelet, and MedPy) to denoise images (using
linear/nonlinear filters, Fast Fourier transform (FFT), and autoencoders). You'll learn how
to implement image enhancement techniques such as histogram equalization/matching,
sketching/cartoonizing, pyramid blending/gradient blending, and edge detection with zero
crossing.

### Chapter 3 
Image Restoration, is where you will learn how to implement image restoration
(using NumPy, scikit-image, OpenCV, and scikit-learn) with deconvolution
(inverse/weiner/LMS) filters. You'll learn how to implement image restoration with
inpainting, variational methods, and sparse dictionary learning. You'll also learn how to
implement steganography/steganalysis techniques with pysteg.

### Chapter 4 
Binary Image Processing, is where you will learn how to use different Python
libraries (NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, and OpenCV) for binary image processing (with
mathematical morphology). You'll learn how to implement morphological operators, filters,
and pattern matching and how to apply them in segmentation, fingerprint enhancement,
counting objects, and blob separation.

### Chapter 5
Image Registration, is where you will learn how to use different Python libraries
(NumPy, scikit-image, OpenCV, and PyStasm) for image matching/registration/stitching.
You'll learn how to implement image registration techniques with warping/feature
(SIFT/SURF/ORB)-based methods and the RANSAC algorithm. You'll also learn how to
implement panorama image creation, and face morphing, as well as how to implement a
basic image search engine.

### Chapter 6
Image Segmentation, is where you will learn how to use different Python libraries
(NumPy, scikit-image, OpenCV, SimpleITK, and DeepLab) for image segmentation. You'll
learn how to implement image segmentation techniques with graph-based
methods/clustering methods, super-pixelation, and machine learning algorithms. You'll
also learn how to implement semantic segmentation with DeepLab.

### Chapter 7 
Image Classification, is where you will learn how to use different Python libraries
(scikit-learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch) for image classification. You'll
learn how to implement deep learning-based techniques such as transfer learning/finetuning.
You'll learn how to implement panorama image creation and face morphing. You'll
also learn how to implement deep learning-based classification techniques for hand
gestures and traffic signals.

### Chapter 8 
Object Detection in Images, is where you will learn how to use different Python
libraries (scikit-learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch) for object detection in
images. You'll learn how to implement classical machine learning (HOG/SVM) techniques
as well as deep learning models to detect objects. You'll also learn how to implement
barcode detection and text detection from images.

### Chapter 9 
Face Detection and Recognition, is where you will learn how to use different
Python libraries and models (scikit-learn, OpenCV, dlib, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, DeepFace, and
FaceNet) for face detection in images. You'll also learn how to implement facial keypoint
recognition and facial/emotion/gender recognition with deep learning.
